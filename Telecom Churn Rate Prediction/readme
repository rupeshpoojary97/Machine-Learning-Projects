## 1.1 Business Problem Overview
In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. It costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention is even more important than customer acquisition.

## 1.2 Business Objective
To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn. The business objective is to predict the churn for prepaid customers in the last (i.e. the ninth) month using the data (features) from the first three months.

### 1.2.1 Customer behaviour during churn
Following customer behaviour is the basis of churn detection strategy.

Customers usually do not decide to switch to another competitor instantly, but rather over a period of time (this is especially applicable to high-value customers). In churn prediction, following three phases of customer lifecycle are considered

The ‘good’ phase: In this phase, the customer is happy with the service and behaves as usual.

The ‘action’ phase: The customer experience starts to sore in this phase, for e.g. he/she gets a compelling offer from a competitor, faces unjust charges, becomes unhappy with service quality etc. In this phase, the customer usually shows different behaviour than the ‘good’ months. Also, it is crucial to identify high-churn-risk customers in this phase, since some corrective actions can be taken at this point (such as matching the competitor’s offer/improving the service quality etc.)

The ‘churn’ phase: In this phase, the customer is said to have churned. Churn is defined based on this phase.

### 1.2.2 Churn detection strategy
High-value Churn : In the Indian and the southeast Asian market, approximately 80% of revenue comes from the top 20% customers (called high-value customers). Thus with reduction of high-value customers churn, business will be able to reduce significant revenue leakage.

Usage-based churn: Customers who have not done any usage, either incoming or outgoing - in terms of calls, internet etc. over a period of time are termed as churned customers
